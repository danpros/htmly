Requirements
------------
HTMLy requires PHP 5.3 or greater.

Installations
-------------
Download the latest version, extract it, then upload the extracted files to your server. Make sure the installation folder is writeable by your server.

Configurations
--------------
Rename `config.ini.example` inside `config` folder to `config.ini` or you can create it one than change the site settings there, create `YourUsername.ini` inside `config/users` folder or simply rename the `username.ini.example`, write down your password there.

````
password = YourPassword
````

HTMLy support admin user role either, simply add the following to your choosen user:

````
role = admin
````

Admin role can edit/delete all users posts.

You can login to admin panel at `www.example.com/login`.

### Lighttpd
Here a example configuration

````
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/config" {
  url.access-deny = ( "" )
}
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/system/includes" {
  url.access-deny = ( "" )
}
$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/system/admin/views" {
  url.access-deny = ( "" )
}

url.rewrite-once = (
  "^/(themes|system|vendor)/(.*)" => "$0",
  "^/(.*\.php)" => "$0",

  # Everything else is handles by htmly
  "^/(.*)$" => "/index.php/$1"
)
````

Both Online or Offline
----------------------
In addition by using the built-in editor in the admin panel, you can also write it offline and then upload them into `content/username/blog` folder (the username must match with `YourUsername.ini` above). 

For static pages you can upload it to `content/static` folder.

File Naming Convention
----------------------
When you write a blog post and save it via the admin panel, HTMLy automatically create a .md file extension with the following name, example:

````
2014-01-31-12-56-40_tag1,tag2,tag3_databaseless-blogging-platform-flat-file-blog.md
````

Here's the explanation (separated by an underscore):

- `2014-01-31-12-56-40` is the published date. The date format is `yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss`
- `tag1,tag2,tag3` is the tag, separated by comma
- `databaseless-blogging-platform-flat-file-blog` is the URL

For static pages, we use the following format:

````
about.md
````

That is means if `about` is the URL.

So if you write it offline then you must naming the .md file as above.

Content Title
-------------
If you write it offline, for the title of the post you need to add a title in the following format:

    <!--t Here is the post title t-->

	Paragraph 1

	Paragraph 2 etc.

So wrap the title with HTML comment with `t` for both side.
